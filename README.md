## 📌 Project Overview

Fake news has become a major challenge in today's digital world. This project uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to automatically classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real**.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, text cleaning, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a machine learning model to classify fake and real news.
- Apply Natural Language Processing techniques for text preprocessing.
- Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF.
- Train and evaluate a Logistic Regression classifier.
- Save the trained model for future predictions.

---

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the **Fake and Real News Dataset** consisting of two CSV files:

- **Fake.csv**
- **True.csv**

Each news article contains:

- Title
- Text
- Subject
- Date

After preprocessing:

- Fake News → Label **0**
- Real News → Label **1**

> **Note:** The dataset is not included in this repository due to its size. You can download it from Kaggle.
