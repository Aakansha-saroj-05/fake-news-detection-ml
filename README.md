# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and multiple supervised learning algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The spread of fake news on digital platforms has become a major concern. This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to automatically identify whether a news article is real or fake.

The project compares the performance of multiple machine learning models and selects the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
